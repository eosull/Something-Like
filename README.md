# About
This is some info about this project.

# Design
This section provides information on the design process of the project. It will be outlined using the five planes of UX; **Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface**.

## Strategy
The strategy plane focuses on what is aimed at being acheived, and for whom. Following design thinking practices a problem statement was generated to summarise the needs of a user:

- *I, Eoin, as a lover of music/books/film am trying to find new recommendations for each of these. I find it difficult to connect with works that are algorithmically suggested via streaming apps because so many options are presented. This can feel overwhelming and can lead what is being recommended to feel somewhat disposable. I do not feel the connection I did to the work when for example: a friend gives me a book or an older family member gives me an album.*

Considering how these needs could be met was key in developing the strategy for this project. In this statement, the user is overwhelmed by choices provided by streaming sites and is searching for the connection they feel to media they encounter it as a result of a personalised recommendation. Therefore, the central goal of the site is to **provide a platform for users looking for film, music or book recommendations to share personalised recommendations with one another**.
