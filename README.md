# About
This is some info about this project.

# Design
This section provides information on the design process of the project. It will be outlined using the five planes of UX; **Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface**.

## Strategy
The strategy plane focuses on what the project aims to acheive, and for whom. Following design thinking practices a problem statement was generated to summarise the needs of a user:

- *I, Eoin, as a lover of music/books/film am trying to find new recommendations for each of these. I find it difficult to connect with works that are algorithmically suggested via streaming apps because so many options are presented. This can feel overwhelming and can lead what is being recommended to feel somewhat disposable. I do not feel the connection I did to the work when for example: a friend gives me a book or an older family member gives me an album.*

Considering how these needs could be met was key in developing the strategy for this project. In this statement, the user is overwhelmed by choices provided by streaming sites and is searching for the connection they feel to media they encounter as a result of a personalised recommendation. Therefore, the central goal of the site is to **provide a platform for users looking for film, music or book recommendations to share personalised recommendations with one another**.

## Scope
Building on from the strategy and the goal outlined above, the scope of the project is concerned with the features to be included in the project.

### User Experience
The site should be:
- Intuitive and easily navigable
- Provide feedback to user actions
- Responsive to different screen sizes
- Accessible

### Functionality
The main functionalities of the site are as follows:
- A user can register and login, becoming authorised.
- An unauthorised user can view posts and comments on the site.
- An authorised user can create a categorised post detailing a piece of work they like. This post serves as an invitation for recommendations from other users.
- An authorised user can comment on a post.
- An authorised user can edit and delete their posts and comments.

### Content
The site should contain the following core content:
- Post previews, post details and categorised posts.
- Comments underneath posts

The implementation of these features successfully is the MVP for this project and are intended to be built on once they have been acheived. Implemented features and future additions will be detailed further in [Features Section](#features).

## Structure
The structure of the site was designed with two parts in mind; information design and the interaction design. Information design is concerned with how the information is structured on the site and the interaction design is concerned with how the user navigates this.

The site is designed so the home page is the hub from where the user can access all other features. Certain features are only accessible to authorised users. Unauthorised users will have access to read functionality, whereas create, edit and delete functionality will be limited to users with an account.

The nav elements will always be accessible via the header on the site. Feedback is provided for any action that creates or alters content via the use of confirmation messages.

An entity relationship diagram was created for the purpose of meeting the MVP of the project, providing data models for: **Users**, **Posts** and **Comments**. Each of these have a primary ID key and multiple foreign keys. The relationships are as follows, outlined as well in diagram below:
- User to Posts = Only One to Zero or Many
- User to Comments = Only One to Zero or Many
- Posts to Comments = Only One to Zero or Many

|Data Model ERD 1st design|

After 1st Mentor meeting (project inception stage), a few alterations were suggested for the data model. The alterations can be seen in the model below. They consist of the creation of a categories model to be used for storing category information and mapped to multiple posts and the addition of an edited key in the post and comment model to show if they have been edited.

| ![Data Model ERD mk.2](/assets/readme_images/erd_2.png) |

|Data Model ERD 2nd design|

Upon revision of ERD and Django data models, the decision was made to implement a custom data model that extends the in built Django User model. This decision was made in order to allow extra fields to be added with greater ease in future development of the data model. Additional fields were also added to the Category and Comments model.

| ![Data Model ERD mk.3](/assets/readme_images/erd_3.png) |

|Data Model ERD 3rd design|

After facing difficulties implementing login/register functionality, the decision was taken to drop the current user model and to use the default Django user model combined with AllAuth for authentication. Updated ERD is below.

| ![Data Model ERD mk.4](/assets/readme_images/erd_4.png) |

|Data Model ERD 4th design|

Likes have been added to both the Comment and Post data model while edited time has been added to Post data model.

|Data Model ERD 5th design|

This model may evolve as the project develops and MVP targets are met, any development will be detailed here.

## Skeleton
A simple wireframe of the site was created to visualise navigation, layout and design. Some features included in the wireframe are not mandatory and would be considered nice to have. If these are not included a rationale will be included in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. This wireframe can be seen below.

## Surface
The surface level of the project, including color schemes, font styling and images will be developed as the site is built. This will be documented here.

### Colour Scheme
 - The background of the site is a light grey #bebcc2
 - The post preview cards are an off-white #fcfcfc
 - The bootstrap built in primary button has been made a lighter blue #6596cd

### Font Styling
Google Fonts was used to import fonts. Initially a simplistic Roboto Mono was chosen to keep the site looking clean. Different font weights were used to highlight specific elements with a heavier weight for titles, headings and nav links and a lighter weight for post content and messages.ÃŸ

## Sprints
Working sprints were undertaken with the MVP of the project in mind to complete the development. They are as follows:

### Sprint 1 (17/04/2023-23/04/2023) - [Design](#design)
This sprint consisted of brainstorming sessions, project requirement consideration and research. Emerging from this was a site concept, basic wireframes, ERD and Epics with user stories.

### Sprint 2 (24/04/2023-30/04/2023) - [Project Setup](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/1)
This sprint consisted of setting up the requirements to develop a full-stack project using an agile methodology. This included setting up a repository, workspace and project board.

### Sprint 3 (01/05/2023-02/05/2023) - [Admin Site/Database Build Sprint](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/2)
This Sprint covered the creation of database models for the site and the building of the administration site. This included adding the data models for users, comments, posts and categorys. The creation of a superuser and building of an admin site to edit database was also included.

### Sprint 4 Site Navigation and Templates (02/05/2023-05/05/2023) - [Site Navigation and Templates](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/3)
This sprint covered the creation of views, templates and navigation links in order to create a navigable structure to the site. The end goal of this sprint was to have a site structure where content could be displayed and navigated through.

### Sprint 5 Front End CRUD Functionality (04/05/2023-09/05/2023) - [CRUD Functionality](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/4)
This sprint covered the implementation of CRUD functionality for authorised users via front-end forms. This includes the creation, editing and deleting of posts and comments. Full CRUD functionality for posts was acheived, comment editing and deleting is still to be acheived.

### Sprint 6 Front End Styling Iteration 1 (11/05/2023-16/05/2023) - [Front End Iteration 1](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/5)
This sprint covered the front end design for the first working iteration of the site. This will include structuring, mobile responsiveness, colour schemes and typogrophy.

### Sprint 7 Iteration 2 Sprint (19/05/2023-02/06/2023) - [Iteration 2 Sprint](https://github.com/eosull/Something-Like/milestone/6)
After Sprint 6, the decision was taken to broaden the scope of Sprints, Epics and User Stories. This included a lengthening of sprint time and less rigid tasks in User Stories. The focus has now shifted from individual functionality and structural elements to an iteration based workflow. The core structure of the site has been completed and from this point on the working sprints will be with the next iteration in mind. The first iteration was focused on functionality and meeting core MVP targets. This iteration builds on this, adds features and aims to create a more engaging product.

# Features
These are some of the features of the project.

# Tools and Technologies
These are the tools and technologies used in the development of the project.

# Testing
These are the testing processes that were carried out.

## Iteration 1 Testing 

###Â Accessibility 

Lighthouse Testing was conducted on the first iteration of the site to detect accessibility issues with the initial design. A score of 100 was acheived with nothing to address at this stage of development.

###Â HTML 

The code at this stage of development was passed into the [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), with 2 solvable issues being presented - button hierarchy on Edit Post page and form action on Delete Post page. Both of these issues were resolved.

| ![Iteration 1 HTML Button Error](/assets/readme_images/iteration1_button_html_error.png) |

| ![Iteration 1 HTML Form Action Error](/assets/readme_images/iteration1_form_action_error.png) |
|:--:|
|Iteration 1 HTML Form Action Error|

The other issues highlighted by the validator were related to the use of Django templating in the HTML files.

Python testing will commence at the completion of Iteration 2 of the site.

## Iteration 2 Testing

### Python

Manual testing was completed to ensure views, urls and templates were hooked up properly. Forms were also tested to ensure they functioned as intended.

The [Django testing modules](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/testing/overview/) were used to automate testing of python code. These use the Python standard library module unittest. A separate testing database is used while test cases are run and then deleted. For testing the views the django Client module was used simulating get and post requests. I used a [combination of coverage and django-nose](https://django-testing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coverage.html) to measure test coverage for my app as I built the tests.

The first tests were built for the models in the test_models.py file, testing methods like string return and counting functionality. Then the basic functionality for the views such as redirects and correct template usage were built in test_views.py.

This resulted in the models having 100% test coverage and views having 62% coverage, as seen in ouput below. This will be developed on further in Iteration 3.

|Iteration 1 Python Testing Coverage|

###Â Javascript

Javascript automated testing using Jest was not implemented in this Iteration due to the minimal amount of JS present (One function to time out messages). This was manually tested and further JS added will be subject to automated testing.

###Â HTML 

The code at this stage of development was passed into the [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), some small issues were presented such as extra closing tags and unecessary closing slash on input elements. These were resolved and no issues currently showing. 

###Â CSS

CSS code was passed into the [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors were found.

###Â Accessibility 

Running lighthouse test on the site at this stage produced a score of 100 for accessibility.

###Â Site Goal testing

#### User Experience
The site should is intuitive and easily navigable, provides feedback to user actions, responsive to different screen sizes and accessible.

#### Functionality
A user can register and login, becoming authorised. They can then create a categorised post detailing a piece of work they like. They can also comment on other posts as well as edit and delete their posts and comments. Unauthorised users can view posts and comments on the site.

#### Content
The site contains core content of post previews, post details categorised posts and comments underneath posts

# Bugs
Deployment to Heroku: build was failing on Heroku and I was met with the following error: *ERROR: Could not build wheels for backports.zoneinfo, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects*. A search on slack [found a student](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/CHDVDV2Q4/p1681717148021239) who had faced a similar issue, the cause being heroku is using a new version of Python and needs to be told to use an older version for backports.zoneinfo to run. Good info and possible solution found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71712258/error-could-not-build-wheels-for-backports-zoneinfo-which-is-required-to-insta). Added runtime.txt file in directory and specified use of python-3.11.3 to resolve. This didn't work as I was getting the same error. Found more people facing the same issue on Slack and avoiding the install of backports if python version is greater that 3.9 [was suggested](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C026PTF46F5/p1677505066005429). This worked and project was successfully deployed to Heroku.

Custom User Model: The initial plan for development was to create a custom user model that would allow for further customation as the project developed. This was created in a separate accounts app. Upon trying to implement login/register functionality this was creating problems with connecting urls, views and templates as well as taking up a lot of development time. The decision was taken to remove this accounts app and stick to the perfectly adequete Django default user model and use AllAuth for authentication in order to keep development moving and to reach the MVP sooner.

Commenting: When trying to submit a comment I kept getting a Django error message telling me the comment form field 'author_id' was null and this violated not-null constraint. To resolve this I added the following line in the post method of blog/views.py to use the id in the request to fill this field: comment_form.instance.author_id = request.user.id .

Editing: I used 2 auto-generated time-stamps (one set at creation and one that changes with each edit) and a comparison function to find out whether or not posts had been edited. These were never equal so would never display as not edited. Using the console to inspect values I figured out the issue was with microsecond DateTimeField value (see image below). I used .replace(microsecond=0) in the comparison function to only make the comparison between date and hour/minute/seconds and the edited functionality worked.
